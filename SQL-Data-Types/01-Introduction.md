# Introduction

Welcome! This is Understanding Data Types, the second course in the Creating Database Structure track.

From the first course in the track, you already know a few basic data types â€“ `integer`, `varchar`, and `date`. This course introduces more data types and explains them in detail.

Once you complete this course, you'll have a good understanding of what data types are available in databases. You'll also be able to choose the best data type for a given situation.

Shall we get started?
